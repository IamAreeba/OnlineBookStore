// ================================== 01: Identity Scaffolding ==============================
/*
    . When project is built first we will not see Identity pages like Login and Register to see them we need to scaffold them.
    . Since we have configured the Individual Identity Account so it has configured alot of things for us e.g. DBContext class, Migrations folder etc
    . We dont have to configure DBContext cuz it has did connectivity stuff by which we connet to DB.
    . When u run the project u will see Identity/Account/Login when click on Login link but when u see the folder structure u will not see any Identity folder for this we have to do scafolding.
    . Scaffolding is a way to quickly generate code for common application features, such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and more.
